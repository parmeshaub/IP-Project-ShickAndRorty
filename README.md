# IP-Project-ShickAndRorty

Shaun and Reynard's IP Project

## Project Name & Design Process

Our IP project name for this assignment is called Shick & Rorty. Our project is a text-based adventure game (detective theme), the title of the website and game is called Dusk Of Lies. To have an introduction on what it means, "Dusk of Lies" is a gripping text-based detective game that immerses players in a dark and complex world of crime and deception. Set in a city shrouded in shadows, players take on the role of a seasoned detective tasked with solving a series of high-stakes cases that are shrouded in secrecy and lies. We have made sure that the login/register API system and design works and can connect to the webpage, we have made a 3D model rewarding system connected to the game with its API system and we have ensured that the design is well developed and not too complex and confusing to use.

## Technologies Used

In order for us to build our websites and games we used a lot of tools which helped me to make it possible:

1. We used Maya, 3D Substance painter, Photoshop and Illustrator to help us create our 3D models, assets and other pictures necessary to put
   in our website and game

2. Image resizer: https://imageresizer.com/
   Image resizer helped to resize my pictures so that our icons and images needed for the website are perfect enough to fit and won't have much trouble during the padding's and margin's code of CSS.

3. Image background remover: https://photoscissors.com/
   Image background remover helped to remove any unnecessary background colors or wordings as it might not fit with the website theme.

4. Youtube videos to mp4: https://snapsave.io/en4/youtube-mp4
   This is one of the most useful tool to help convert youtube video files or links to mp4 file.

5. HTML, CSS and Javascript code references and examples: https://www.w3schools.com/
   This is arguably the most helpful tool that helped us guide throughout the assignment especially in the case of styling and animating it. How to place the pictures, effects, which placements needed and more.

6. Youtube: Asides from the code references website, we do also look up Youtube to look for inspirations of other people design their websites.
